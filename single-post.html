               <p>What do you think of when you picture a technology professional? You probably envision someone working in seclusion, pounding away at a keyboard for hours at a time, composing countless lines of confusing code. It’s true that some tech pros do that, but not all jobs in technology revolve around programming.</p>

              <p><strong>Project Managers</strong> are masters at making sure IT projects stay on time and on budget. This position would require you to plan projects, guide technical staff and help bridge the gap between the business side of the company and the technical side.Keeping everyone on task is the main goal – if the project falls behind, the IT project manager will have to answer a lot of questions from an unhappy boss.It’s critical that project managers actually understand what the project needs, as opposed to what the written requirements of the project are, according to Rob Fitzgerald of The Lorenzi Group.It’s likely that everyone you’ll be working with will have an abundance of tech skills, but you won’t have to. Some skills you will need include time management, coordination, critical thinking and management skills, according to O*Net Online.</p>

              <p><strong>QA Analysts</strong> are responsible for finding bugs in software, reporting those issues and following up to ensure any errors have been corrected. This means you’ll spend a lot of time testing and using programs like Bugzilla or JIRA to log the problems you encounter, but you won’t be the one actually fixing the problems.“As a manual QA analyst I will be the first to admit I am not a programmer,” says Zach Ribbe, QA Specialist at Collegis Education.** “Programming is still a foreign concept to me at times.”Some specific skills QA analysts need, according to O*Net Online, include: active listening, complex problem solving, critical thinking and systems evaluation. Interacting with others is a large part of the job, so it’s important to have superior interpersonal skills.Ribbe says that QA analysts don’t have to type any code but that some knowledge of code is helpful because it makes your reporting more effective. “Your main duty is to find and report the issues, and see that they are fixed by the development team,” he says.</p>

              <p>To do front-end stuff (how the data is presented to the user or view), you'd normally use HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's imperative to know that search engines ignore Javascript (JS) so if you want your content to be indexed in search engines (SE), make sure your content is accessible without JS.</p>

              <p>A simple web stack could be an application server such as Apache that runs a Python application. After that,  It's important to know about design patterns, a common one is MVC (Model–View–Controller).Following that, you should know about data:<strong> persistence, structures and retrieval. SQL is commonly used to retrieve information from a database.</strong> In a MVC app, data persistence is referred as a model. Caching is important if you want to retrieve data that takes a while to compute fast. Some people like ORM Object-relational mapping. I hate them because there are really bad implementations out there. I wasted lots of time trying to optimise them and there is a learning curve for each one..</p>

              <p>Well! It's quite easy you must understand the concept of life cycle of any web technologies. It has common stuff and mechanism, then you can learn about data binding,<strong> POJO (Plain Old Java Object), data mapping, data access object, controller and so on. In addtion, web technologies nowadays can receive data package by webservice (SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol and RESTful - Representational State Transfer).</strong></p>
